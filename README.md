# RSSFeedDemo
RSS is a type of web feed which easily allows a user to keep track of updates from a website. Furthermore, RSS feeds are based on an XML file which summarizes the content of a site. A news aggregator can then subscribe to one or more feeds and display the updates by regularly checking if the XML has changed.
